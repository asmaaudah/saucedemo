# Saucedemo Web Automation Project

This project contains automated test scripts for the [Saucedemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) website using Katalon Studio. The aim is to ensure the functionality and performance of the site through comprehensive automated tests.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the automation scripts, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone/Download the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saucedemo-web-automation.git
```

### 2. Open the Project in Katalon Studio

1. Open Katalon Studio.
2. Select **File > Open Project**.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the project.

### 3. Configure Test Execution

Ensure that you have configured the following:

1. **Test Data**: Make sure the test data (if any) is correctly set up.
2. **Global Variables**: Update global variables as needed for the environment you are testing.

### 4. Running Tests

You can run the test cases in two ways:

#### a. Directly from Katalon Studio

1. Open the **Test Explorer**.
2. Right-click on the test suite you want to run.
3. Select **Run with > Chrome** (or any other browser you prefer).

#### b. Using Command Line

You can run the tests from the command line using Katalon's CLI:

```bash
katalon -noSplash -runMode=console -projectPath="path_to_your_project.prj" -retry=0 -testSuitePath="Test Suites/YourTestSuite" -executionProfile="default" -browserType="Chrome"
```

Replace `path_to_your_project.prj` with the actual path to your Katalon project and `Test Suites/YourTestSuite` with the path to your test suite.

### 5. Viewing Reports

Katalon Studio generates reports after test execution. You can view them in the **Reports** section in Katalon Studio or navigate to the `Reports` directory in your project folder.
